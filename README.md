# Todoers

Todoers is a web project, that is supposed to get more and more complex. Started from a simple todo app, the goal of this project is to show off my web skills, and keep them up to date.

## Installation

Before trying anything, you first need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Download the project, either by using git (if you know git, you definitely know how to do this part), we will focus on the zip way.
- Extract the file, and copy the path of the extracted folder.
- Open the Windows PowerShell (you may need to open it with administrator rights).
- Run ```cd <path to the project>```
- Run ```npm install```, this command will install all the necessary dependencies for the project to work.
- When the install is done, you finally run ```npm run start```, this will run the project, your default web browser should open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) automatically, if it doesn't, open it yourself.
- You should see now the project's face.

## Features

This is a basic todo app, so dont expect crazy features.

Todos, are added to groups. Groups helps you organize your todos. But also give more steps and details for one todo, by linking it to a group.
