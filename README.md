# Todoers

Todoers is a web project, that is supposed to get more and more complex. Started from a simple todo app, the goal of this project is to show off my web skills, and keep them up to date.

## Installation

Before trying anything, you first need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Download the project, either by using git (if you know git, you definetely know how to do this part), we will focus on the zip way.
- Extract the file, and copy the path of the extracted folder.
- Open Windows PowerShell (you may need to open it with administrator rights).
- Run ```cd <path to the project>```
- Run ```npm install```, this command will install all the necessary dependencies for the project to work.
- When the install is done, you run ```npm run start```, this will finally run the project, your default web browser should open automatically [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), if it doesn't open it yourself.
- You should now see the project face.
